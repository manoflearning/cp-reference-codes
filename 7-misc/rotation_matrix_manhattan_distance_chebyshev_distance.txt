Rotation Matrix (In Two Dimensions)

x' = x * cosθ - y * sinθ
y' = x * sinθ + y * cosθ

Manhattan Distance, Chebyshev Distance

For any two points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) on two-dimensional coordinates,
- the Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
- the Chebyshev distance is max(|x1 - x2|, |y1 - y2|).

Relationship between Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance

Let x1' = x1 - y1, y1' = x1 + y1,
x2' = x2 - y2, y2' = x2 + y2. (using Rotation matrix)

Then max(|x1 - x2|, |y1 - y2|)
= (|x1' - x2'| + |y1' - y2'|).

Thus, Manhattan distance can be solved by replacing it with Chebyshev distance, and vice versa.
